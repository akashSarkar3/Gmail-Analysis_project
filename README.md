# Gmail-Analysis_project

**Objective:**
Develop and evaluate spam detection models using Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers to effectively classify emails as spam or legitimate (ham).

**Dataset:**
A labeled dataset containing email text and their corresponding spam/ham labels. The data was preprocessed and converted into numerical features using CountVectorizer.

**Spam Detection Model Evaluation**

**1. Naïve Bayes Model**

**Accuracy: 94%**

**2. SVM Model**

**Accuracy: 97%**

**Visualizations:**

**Confusion Matrices:**
Show how many emails were correctly and incorrectly classified as spam or ham. Helps to visualize model performance and identify areas for improvement.
